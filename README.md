100 days of Python in Udemy. Started 11.23.24
100 days from 11.23.24 is 3.2.25

12.13.24 update:
  Completed Day 14 today.
  Will not be done in 100 days.
  Blackjack (Day 11) I have to go back to; got lost in the code and frustrated about not progressing.
  Not confident with defining, or when to call functions.
  Confident with while loops and if statements.
  Getting the hang of for, in loops.
  Terrible with getting a value out of a dictionary that's in a list.
  Lists I have down. Dictionaries are hit and miss. Together, they are tough.
  Booleans are cool. I like them.
  Need to work on coming up with better variable names...
