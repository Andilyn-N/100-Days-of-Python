    # making a simple tip calculator

print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip = int(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10 12 15 "))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))
split = float((bill / people) * ((tip / 100)+1))

    # had a hard time putting the split in a f-function and having it round to 2 decimal places, but this works.

print("Each person should pay: ")
print(round(split, 2))
